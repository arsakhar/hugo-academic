### Overview
This is the third in our trilogy of virtual reality exergames. After conquering the land, you now turn your attention to the sea. Sal plans to build a marine sanctuary and he needs your help. On this adventure, you will take pictures and collect objects that will inspire the underwater sanctuary. You will start by exploring the island and collecting the equipment necessary to begin your descent into the ocean. Sal is planning on sending you pretty deep -- you didn't hear it from me, but I heard he has some secret information on the lost city of Atlantis. We shouldn't speculate, though.

<b>Stay tuned for more to come...</b>
