### <b>Virtual Reality</b>
Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia in older adults. To date, there are no effective disease-modifying treatments, but recent studies shown exercise and cognitive stimulation to be associated with a reduced risk of dementia. As part of my PhD, I led the development of Sal's Sanctuary and Wildlife Enclosure, two fun, engaging, and cognitively challenging virtual reality exergames designed specifically for older adults. These games may enhance overall brain health in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease and studies into their efficacy are currently on-going. A third game, Underwater Adventures, is currently in development. Click the links below to learn more about each game.
