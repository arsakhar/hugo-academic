abstract: "A stylet locking mechanism for preventing axial movement of a stylet relative to a needle of a medical delivery device is disclosed. The locking mechanism comprises first and second ends that may be removably attached to the device, and a hinge for allowing the locking mechanism to be disengaged from a locking position without being completely disconnected from the delivery device."
