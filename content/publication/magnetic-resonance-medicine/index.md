abstract: "
Purpose: Pathological states occur when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) dynamics become dysregulated in the brain. Phase‐contrast MRI (PC‐MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that enables quantitative measurements of CSF and CBF flow. While studies have validated PC‐MRI as an imaging technique for flow, few studies have evaluated its reliability for CSF and CBF flow parameters commonly associated with neurological disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate test–retest reliability at the cerebral aqueduct (CA) and C2‐C3 area using PC‐MRI to assess the feasibility of investigating CSF and CBF flow dynamics.
<br><br>

Methods: This study was performed on 27 cognitively normal young adults (ages 20‐35 years). Flow data was acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma using a 2D cine‐PC pulse sequence. Three consecutive flow measurements were acquired at the CA and C2‐C3 area. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variance (CV) were used to evaluate intrarater, inter‐rater, and test–retest reliability.
<br><br>

Results: Among the 26 flow parameters analyzed, 22 had excellent reliability (ICC > 0.80), including measurements of CSF stroke volume, flush peak, and fill peak, and 4 parameters had good reliability (ICC 0.60‐0.79). 16 flow parameters had a mean CV ≤ 10%, 7 had a CV ≤ 15%, and 3 had a CV ≤ 30%. All CSF and CBF flow measurements had excellent inter‐rater and intrarater reliability (ICC > 0.80).
<br><br>

Conclusion: This study shows that CSF and CBF flow can be reliably measured at the CA and C2‐C3 area using PC‐MRI, making it a promising tool for studying flow dynamics in the central nervous system."
