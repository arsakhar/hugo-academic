### <b>Inspiration</b>

Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia in older adults. To date, there are no effective disease-modifying treatments, but recent studies have shown exercise and cognitive stimulation to be
associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Virtual reality is a promising technology for combining exercise and cognitive stimulation and may enhance brain health in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.

### <b>Games</b>
Sal's Sanctuary and Wildlife Enclosure are two fun, engaging, and cognitively challenging virtual reality exergames designed specifically for older adults. A third game, Underwater Adventures is currently in development.

<a href="/project/sals-sanctuary/">Sal's Sanctuary</a> - Rescue animals that have escaped the sanctuary while navigating an urban environment

<a href="/project/wildlife-enclosure/">Wildlife Enclosure</a> - Look after and take care of rescued animals located in exotic environments

<b>Underwater Adventures (In Development)</b> - Explore and photograph aquatic life in this underwater world
