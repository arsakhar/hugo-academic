I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in programming, applied
statistical data analysis, and applying ML algorithms to medical imaging.
I also have 5+ yearsâ€™ experience in neuroimaging, virtual reality,
software development, game development, and conducting clinical trials.
I am a collaborative researcher who excels in multi-disciplinary environments.
