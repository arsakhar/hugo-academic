I am an academic researcher with a passion for problem solving and innovation in healthcare. I am currently utilizing novel MRI imaging techniques to elucidate the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. As an extension of this work, I am also developing a virtual reality game to remediate cognitive decline in older adults. I have expertise in brain imaging, virtual reality, game development, and data science. I am a collaborative researcher who excels in multi-disciplinary environments.
